# Gradient Descent Visualization

Welcome to the **Gradient Descent Visualization** repository! This project aims to explain the concept of gradient descent, a popular optimization technique in machine learning, by visualizing its steps in real-time.

## About the Project

Gradient descent is an algorithm used to minimize a function iteratively by moving in the direction of the steepest descent. In this repository, you will find an interactive notebook where you can:
- Select from various functions to apply gradient descent.
- See how the algorithm adjusts the parameter values to find the minimum.
- Visualize the steps and convergence of the algorithm.

## Features

- Choose from a set of predefined functions, including quadratic, cubic, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions.
- Visualize the gradient descent steps and the trajectory toward the function's minimum.
- Learn about the impact of learning rate, stopping conditions, and other parameters.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or open it directly on GitHub.
2. Open the notebook and follow the instructions to choose a function.
3. Observe the gradient descent steps and watch the convergence in action.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `sympy`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `IPython`

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
